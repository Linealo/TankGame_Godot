 A Godot 2-Player Tank Game - Basic Version

This Repository saves the game data for the Tank Game I developed for Marcos martinez "Creative Programming" course in 2023 at the Hochschule Bremerhaven.
While the code is all mine, soem graphics and sounds have been aquired through Itch.Io and other ressources.
As a co-author Sarah Blank is to be mentioned, though the contirbution result more on the side of documentation and finilisation for the study module this was created in.

About the Game:
In the game multiple players (for now in V1 only two) participate in a tank battle against each other. 
ThereÂ´s multiple powerUps through the game that can be collected and modify the players or enemies behavior and or bullets.

Goal is to strike down the enemie player as fast as possible without dying yourself.
